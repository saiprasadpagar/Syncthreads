<p>ASSIGNMENT
1. Find appropriate library to integrate map(open street) in a REACT application (open source). Do
not use Google iFrame.
2. Create APIs for
a. Login
b. Dashboard
c. Map view.
3. For authentication, use the best method possible (instead of private routing)
4. If a user is logged in, he/she should be routed to the dashboard. The dashboard has card
components each having a unique ID. On click of the card component, it should open a map
view and display the map of India with current location being zoomed out.
5. Zoom in and zoom out functionality should work well
6. If the user is not logged in, the dashboard and map view api should show a message “User
not logged in”.
NOTE: You will be judged on:
1. what packages you use
2. Code quality
3. UI quality - IT HAS TO BE CREATIVE
4. Backend
NOTE : Make sure to follow coding standards. Try to code as much as REACTJS (functional/class
component) instead of pure javascript.</p>
